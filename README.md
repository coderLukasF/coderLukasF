## 👋 Hello, I'm Lukas!
When I code, I use these programming languages:

Im a frontend, backend, and partial game developer! I have had a passion for coding since I was 9, and still do! I am mainly a self-tought coder, which basically means have 2000+ hours on coding tutorials on youtube. I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript for my frontend development, and Node.JS with MongoDB for my backend. I make games every once in a while in Godot, but I'm not mainly a game developer, I kinda just do it for fun.

I also LOVE writing things! Ive written books ever since I was a kid, and because of that I am a SUPER fast writer and typer! If you see me contributing to coding tutorial repos or things like that, its just because I love writing things!

Now its time to talk about my projects. I actually dont have many real projects, since most of my coding career is just messing around with stuff. I do have a business called stardesigns where I make websites for people, but I am currently working on a big project right now!

I **love** contributing to the open source community, and thats mainly why I am here!

Sometimes I will accidentally log into my test account, @stardesignstestaccount. If you see any commits from there, its because I logged into the wrong account. Still me though!

(By the way, my commit chart thing whatever you want to call it is not accurate because I usually commit from my homelab account, not my github account, resulting in "Lukas" commiting, not coderLukasF)
